TODO (for GPU): 
\begin{todolist} 
\item compute weights on GPU
\item compare SpMV to CUSP/VCL
\item SpMV optimizations
\item JAD/ELL formats 
\item query neighbors on the GPU (follow SPH algorithm in papers)
\item ILU on GPU, preconditioners from Li and Saad, other preconditioners from Saad book
\item Run test cases for GW sets. Generate MILLION node sets. 
\item benchmark neighbor query for k-D Tree and LSH on large node sets
\item Incorporate related work for incompressible fluid flow on GPU: GIN3D, FEAST-GPU, etc. 
\end{todolist}
