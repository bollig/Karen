- Overlap comm & comp (Friday-Sunday) 

- LU w/ Pivoting for weights (Need to demonstrate GFLOPs boost)

- ILU GPU

- Node orderings U, X, Z code

- Metis decompose to disk, load parts and execute (Unified)

- clSpMV multi-GPU (how to handle overlap? impact of orderings on disabled/override sorting?)

- SIMPLE fluid algorithm to simulate mantle
