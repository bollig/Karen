- Convergence study CosineBell operator (no discontinuity at pole). How much do
  we lose by splitting the operator? 

- Benchmark for VCL GMRES on various sparse matrices (Match list from Bahi, Li and Saad)
    - Repeat Benchmark for my Serial and Parallel implementation
    - Requires GFLOPS, Iterations per second

- Benchmark for VCL SpMV vs Vortex. Is it more efficient to use VCL? 
    - Repeat for split operator.


- Multi-color graph re-order according to color, gpu warp per color?

- Optimizations: 
    - Align weights to nearest 128 byte segment
    - Shared memory banks
    - Group larger than warp size
    - Warp handle multiple stencils. How many stencils can fit in shared memory assuming threads operate on stencil in different shared memory elements
    - Parallel reduction (use example code)

- LU for weights on GPU

- ILU0 on GPU
