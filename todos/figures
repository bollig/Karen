Figures needed: 

- stencils as approximate neareset neighbors vs exact nearest neigbhors
- stencil gen with binned groups

- GPU cluster
- GPU algorithms 


For now forget looking for the uniqueness in the thesis. Start with what exists and how it compares to papers. At that point the uniqueness will shine.
