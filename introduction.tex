\section{Radial Basis Function Methods for PDEs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Easily extend to higher dimensions
\item High rate of convergence (exponential for global RBFs)
\item Successful applications to wide range of geophysical applications
\item Global, Compact, FD, MQ-FD, DQ-FD, and even DRBEM methods
\item We emphasize RBF-FD due to its low computational complexity and parallel nature
\end{itemize} 

\section{RBF-FD applications} 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item RBF-FD is applied to hyperbolic PDEs (Flyer, Wright, Lehto, Fornberg, etc)
	\item RBF-FD applied to elliptic PDEs 
	\item We study RBF-FD in context of hyperbolic advection and incompressible fluid flow.
\end{itemize} 

\section{RBF Parallelism}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Parallel Global RBF papers
	\item Parallel CSRBF papers
	\item Not much parallelism in the field, so we introduce it via parallel SpMV and parallel preconditioned GMRES
\end{itemize} 

\section{GPU Computing} 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Only Schmidt consider GPU for RBFs
	\item Beyond the parallel (MPI applications, we port everything to the GPU to leverage the high FLOP per watt hardware. 
\end{itemize} 

\section{Major Challenges}
Disclaimer: RBF-FD is young. As such, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item never parallelized
	\item hand-written code (both CPU and GPU)
	\item Few test cases
	\item My role:
	\begin{itemize} 
	\item Developed test cases (Elliptic, Stokes) which were not seen before
	\item Had to verify method convergence, stability, conditioning, etc for test cases before optimization
	\item Attempted to build components required for a large 3D mantle convection code
	\item Blind implementation to solve PDEs (learned a lot, but wasted lots of time learning about PDEs). 
	\item Original view: Weights times solution values; Current view: Sparse matrix times solution vector. Different perspective makes huge difference in code and parallellization approach.
	\item Resulted in minimal optimization to components
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
