\chapter{Mixed Precision}

In an effort to increase computational throughput on the GPU, we investigated mixed precision options for RBF-FD. 

Mixed precision implies the use of single and double precision operations to increase computation speed but decrease (slightly) the accuracy of the method. 


We found that the sum of weights for a single stencil summed to $O(1e-4)$, a poor approximation to zero which in turn led to a poor approximation of derivative quantities.
