    For their impactful guidance and support I would like to thank Bengt Fornberg, Kiran Katta as a continuous sounding board. 

    Much of my knowledge of GPU programming originated with my work on the
    Master's Thesis at Florida State University in the Summer and Fall 2008
    semesters.

    My first internship in the Summer Internships for Parallel Scientific
    Computational Science (SIParCS) introduced me to the complexities of
    complexities of community models and their use of underlying numerical
    methods. The wonderful guideance of Rory Kelly and Jos\'{e} Garcia showed
    me the importance of reworking numerical methods for the GPU. blah blah.
    Thanks to Michael Oberg, Matthew XXX, Jennifer XXX and John Dennis for
    their guidance

    My dissertation was an attempt to continue the process of improving
    community models. Thanks to NCAR, IMAGe, Ram Nair, Bengt Fornberg, Grady Wright, Joseph Lohmeier, Steven Henke

    Finally,
