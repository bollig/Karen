\begin{itemize} 
    \item perform the same square grid convergence test as shu 2008
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item regular grid spacing
        \item cvt spacing
        \item check error for T1 and T2 as a function of h
        \item check error for T1 and T2 as a function of epsilon
        \item Give average convergence rate for stencil sizes
    \end{itemize} 
\item interleaved vs grouped solution conditioning
\end{itemize}
