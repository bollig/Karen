separate OCL from algorithm
picture of ocl flow
embed code (in appendices)

reorder whats needed
chapter in own files
one large file with all data
benchmark tables
(tomorrow morning)

gmres verification (based on other works)
why would constraints not be necessary in gmres?

partial conclusion section




Tonight: 
=========
one doc
	- all pics
	- all benchmarks in tables
	- all sections (chapter each in independent file)


overlap
rbf-ga
scaling
ordering for matrices (reuse ijk_to_z, ijk_to_u, etc.)


1) GPU
	hardware
		comparison of features
		benchmarks from each
	language
		limitations
	libraries
		ViennaCL
		CUSP
	



Figures: 
	LSH algorithm (high level)
		- hash nodes to coarse grid
		- sort coarse grid by Z order
		- query neighbors with 
	COO, CSR, ELL formats
	BELL, SELL, SBELL
	GMRES orthogonalization
	GMRES preconditioner mask
	GMRES convergence (residual of example problem; i.e., square vs sphere)
	

Data Tables: 
	ViennaCL vs UBLAS benchmarks
	ViennaCL CSR, COO, ELL
	clSpMV SELL, BELL, SBELL
	Weak Scaling benchmarks
	Strong Scaling benchmarks
	GMRES convergence w/ and w/o precond 
	GMRES benchmarks w/ ELL
			 w/ precond
	GMRES convergence of single vs coupled equation
