- Need to explain: 
	ELL
	CSR
	COO
	GPU hardware
	OpenCL
	Where does the GFLOP rate come from
	MPI benchmarks where is the time spent?
	PDEs
	GMRES algorithm (high level; refer to other papers)
	GPU SpMV vs CPU SpMV
	CPU SpMV in UBLAS, MKL(?)

	SpMV on GPU for increasing N (generate new regular grids now that KDTree works well) 

- Need benchmarks: 

    How does SpMV strongly scale as n varies and N is 4096000
        -> tells us how stencil size impacts overlap and how MPI time grows
    How does SpMV weakly scale as N varies for multiple n? 
        -> Tells us how efficient the
