- Need to explain: 
	KDTree
	RCM
	ELL
	CSR
	COO
	GPU hardware
	OpenCL
	Where does the GFLOP rate come from
	MPI benchmarks where is the time spent?
	PDEs
	GMRES algorithm (high level; refer to other papers)
	GPU SpMV vs CPU SpMV
	CPU SpMV in UBLAS, MKL(?)

	SpMV on GPU for increasing N (generate new regular grids now that KDTree works well)
