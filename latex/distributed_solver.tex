\chapter{A Distributed Multi-GPU RBF-FD Implementation}
\label{chap:rbffd_multi_gpu}
\authnote{Move this to introduction of thesis and related work.} 

%\authnote{Related work for start of Parallel/GPU chapter}
Parallel implementations of RBF methods rely on domain decomposition. Depending on the implementation, domain decomposition not only accelerates solution procedures, but can decrease the ill-conditioning that plague all global RBF methods \cite{Divo2007}. The ill-conditioning is reduced if each domain is treated as a separate RBF domain, and the boundary update is treated separately. Domain decomposition methods for RBFs were introduced by Beatson et al. \cite{Beatson2000} in the year 2000 as a way to increase problem sizes into the millions of nodes.

This work leverages a domain decomposition, but not for the purpose of conditioning. Instead the focus is on decomposing the domain in order to scale RBF-FD across more than a thousand CPU cores of an HPC cluster. Add to this the twist of incorporating a novel implementation on the GPU with overlapping communication and computation. This combination is unmatched in related work. However, RBF methods do have a bit of history of parallel implementations. 

In 2007, Divo and Kassab \cite{Divo2007} used a domain decomposition method with artificial 
subdomain boundaries for their implementation of a local collocation method \cite{Divo2007}. 
The subdomains are processed independently, with derivative values 
at artificial boundary points averaged to maintain global consistency of physical values. Their implementation 
was designed for a 36 node cluster, but benchmarks and scalability tests are not provided.

% Divo: it seems almost unnecessary to use domain decomposition if they have the local method.
% I suppose the domain decomposition is necessary for averaging physical values more than RBF collocation.


Kosec and \v{S}arler \cite{Kosec2008} have the only known (to our knowledge) OpenMP implementation for RBFs. The authors parallelize coupled heat transfer 
and fluid flow problems on a single workstation. 
The application involves the local RBF collocation method, explicit time-stepping and Neumann boundary conditions. A speedup 
factor of 1.85x over serial execution was achieved by executing on two CPU cores; no further 
results from scaling tests were provided. 

Stevens et al. \cite{Stevens2009a} mention a parallel implementation under development, but no document is available at this time. 

Perhaps the most competitive parallel implementation of RBFs is the PetRBF \cite{Yokota2010} branch of PETSc \cite{PETSc}. The authors of PetRBF (also developers for PETSc) have implemented a highly scalable, efficient RBF interpolation method based on compact RBFs (i.e., they operate on sparse matrices). The authors demonstrate efficient weak scaling of PetRBF across 1024 processes on a Blue Gene/L, and strong scaling up to 128 processes on the same hardware. Additionally, strong scaling was tested on a Cray XT4. On the Blue Gene/L, PetRBF is demonstrated to achieve an impressive 74\% parallel weak scaling efficiency on 1024 processes (operating on over 50 million points), and 84\% strong scaling efficiency for 128 processes. For the Cray XT4, strong scaling tops out at 36\% for 128 processes, a respectable number---and similar to observed results for our own code on 128 processes.  

%TODO Additional RBF implementations are discussed at the end of this chapter in the context of parallel co-processing with the GPU. 

Related work on RBFs and GPUs is sparse. In 2009, Schmidt et al. \cite{Schmidt2009a, Schmidt2009b} implemented a global RBF method for Tsunami simulation on the GPU using the AccelerEyes Jacket \cite{JacketGuide2009} add-on for MATLAB. Jacket provides a MATLAB interface to data structures and routines that internally call to the NVidia CUDA API. Their model was based on a single large dense matrix solve, and with the help of Jacket the authors were able to achieve approximately 7x speedup over the standard MATLAB solution on the then current generation of the MacBook Pro laptop. The authors compared the laptop CPU (processor details not specified) to the built-in NVidia GeForce 8600M GT GPU. Schmidt et al.'s implementation was the first contribution to the RBF community to leverage accelerators. The results were significant and promising, but no further contributions were made on the topic. 

While both Schmidt et al.'s method and our's are based on RBFs, the two problems are only distantly related when it comes to implementation on the GPU. Dense matrix operations have a high computational complexity, are considered ideal (or near to) by linear algebra libraries like BLAS \cite{BLAS} and LAPACK \cite{Lapack1999}, and were demonstrated to fit well on GPUs from the onset of General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) Computing. In fact, NVidia included CUBLAS \cite{CUBLAS} (a GPU based BLAS library for their hardware) with their initial public release of the game-changing CUDA development kit in 2006. In stark contrast to this, sparse matrix operations have minimal computational complexity and are less than ideal for the GPU.


Earlier this year (2013), Cuomo et al. \cite{Cuomo2013} implemented RBF-interpolation on the GPU for surface reconstruction. Their implementation utilizes PetRBF \cite{Yokota2010}, and new built-in extensions that allow GPU access within PETSc. PETSc internally wraps the CUSP project \cite{CUSP} for sparse matrix algebra on the GPU. With the help of these libraries, Cuomo et al. solve and apply sparse interpolation systems on the GPU for up to three million nodes on an NVidia Fermi C1060 GPU (4GB). They compare results to a single core CPU implementation on an Intel i7-940 CPU and demonstrate that the GPU accelerate their solutions between 6x and 25x. Unfortunately, the authors do not show evidence of scaling the interpolation across multiple GPUs; so while evidence exists that PetRBF now has full GPU support, it remains to be seen how well the code can scale in GPU mode.

\section{GPGPU}
GPGPU evolution
\subsection{OpenCL}
OpenCL is chosen with the future in mind. Hardware changes rapidly and vendors often leapfrog one another in the performance race. By selecting OpenCL, we hedge our bets on the functional portability

\subsection{Hardware Layout}
Modern GPUs have a memory hierarchy and hardware layout. 

\section{Performance}
\subsection{GFLOP Throughput}
In order to quantify the performance of our implementation, we can measure two
factors. First, we can check the speedup achieved on the GPU relative to the
CPU to get an idea of how much return of investment is to be expected by all
the effort in porting the application to the GPU. Speedup is measured as the
time to execute on the CPU divided by the time to execute on the GPU. 

The second quantification is to check the throughput of the process. By
quantifying the GFLOP throughput we have a measure that tells us two things:
first, a concrete number quantifying the amount of work performed per second by
either hardware, and second because we can calculate the peak throughput possible on
each hardware, we also have a measure of how occupied our CPU/GPU units are.
With the GFLOPs we can also determine the cost per watt for computation and
conclude on what problem sizes the GPU is cost effective to target and use. 

Now, as we parallelize across multiple GPUs, these same numbers can come into
play. However we are also interested in the efficiency. Efficiency is the
speedup divided by the number of processors. With efficiency we have a measure
of how well-utilized processors are as we scale either the problem size (weak)
or the number of processors (strong). As the efficiency diminishes we can
conclude on how many stencils/nodes per processor will keep our processors
occupied balanced with the shortest compute time possible (i.e., we are
maximizing return of investment). 

\subsection{Expectations in Performance}
Many GPU applications claim a 50x or higher speedup. This will never be the case for RBF-FD for the simple reason that the method reduces to an SpMV. The SpMV is a low computational complexity operation with only two operations for every one memory load.

Our assumption with RBF-FD in this manuscript is that all stencils will have equal size. Due to this, the ELL format is preferred as the default. 
 



We are investigating optimizations that target both GPUs and Phi cards for a class of numerical methods based on Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to solve Partial Differential Equations. RBF methods are increasingly popular across disciplines due to their low complexity, natural ability to function in higher dimension with minimal requirements for an underlying mesh, and high-order---in many cases, spectral---accuracy. RBF methods can be viewed as generalizations of many traditional methods such as Finite Difference and Finite Element to allow for truly unstructured grids. This generalization allows one to reuse many of the same techniques (e.g., sparse matrices, iterative solvers, domain decompositions, etc.) to efficiently obtain solutions. The variety of hardware available on Cascade will help us establish a clear argument in the choice of accelerator type and resolve the dilemma between choosing Phi vs GPU for our method. Since RBFs generalize other methods, our results should have broad reaching impact to answer similar questions for related methods.



With the generalization of RBF-FD derivative computation formulated as a sparse matrix multiplication, we can 
% TODO: mention CUSP as alternative but concentrate on VCL
consider the various sparse formats provided by CUSP and ViennaCL. 

%TODO later: \item All stencils with non-uniform size
%TODO: What is the optimal choice of sparse container? How do the sparse containers compare in performance to each other, and to our custom kernels? What can we conclude? 

Compare formats: 
\begin{itemize}
\item ELL
\item COO
\item CSR
\item Other formats such as HYB, JAD, DIA are considered on the GPU
\end{itemize}

How is communication overlap handled with each format? 


Conclude: sparse containers allow increased efficiency compared to our custom kernels. The custom kernels compete with CSR and COO. 


From the definition of RBF-FD we can formulate the problem computationally in two ways. First, stencil operations are independent. Therefore, we can write kernels with perfect parallelism by dedicating a single thread per stencil or a group of threads per stencil.  

Unfortunately, perfect concurrency does not imply perfect or even ideal concurrency on the GPU. 

We first demonstrate the case where one thread is dedicated to each stencil. This is followed by dedicating a group of thread to the stencil. In each case we are operating under the assumption that each stencil is independent on the GPU. 

To further optimize RBF-FD on the GPU, we formulate the problem in terms of a Sparse Matrix-Vector Mulitply (SpMV). When we consider the problem in this light we generate a single Differentiation Matrix that can see two optimizations not possible with our stencil-based view: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item First, the sparse containers used in SpMV allow for their own unique optimizations to compress storage and leverage hardware cache.
\item Evaluation of multiple derivatives can be accumulated by association into one matrix operation. This reduces the total number of floating point operations required per iteration. 
\end{itemize}



We compare the performance of our custom kernel to ViennaCL kernels (ELL, CSR, COO, HYB, DIAG), UBlas (COO, CSR) and Eigen (COO, CSR, ELL)



\chapter{Distributed Solver}
\label{chap:distributed_rbffd}

Parallelizing RBF-FD in a distributed environment requires three
design decisions \cite{Saad2003}. First, the problem is partitioned in some fashion to distribute work across multiple processes. Intelligent partitioning
impacts load balancing of processors and the ratio of computation versus communication; imbalanced computation can result in excessive delay per
iteration as some processors tackle larger problem sizes with others sitting idle. Second, one must determine whether processes have access to all or a subset of node information,
solution values, etc. and establish index mappings that translate between a local context and the global problem. Third, the local ordering of indices is established to improve solver efficiency and/or simplify operations. Node
ordering is also significant in the future discussion of offloading computation to GPUs as it can help to minimize data transfer between CPU and GPU. 

The following sections detail the approach to distributed computing and a few optimizations that allow RBF-FD to scale over a thousand processes. In later chapters these same decisions will tie into the resulting performance of the distributed multi-GPU implementations.

%
%\section{Next}
%
%Parallelization of RBF-FD is achieved at two levels. First, the
%physical domain of the problem is partitioned
%into overlapping subdomains, each handled by a different MPI process. All CPUs
%operate independently to compute/load RBF-FD stencil weights, run diagnostic
%tests and perform other initialization tasks. A CPU computes only weights
%corresponding to stencils centered in the interior of its partition. After
%initialization, CPUs continue concurrently to solve the PDE. Communication
%barriers ensure that the CPUs execute in lockstep to maintain consistent
%solution values in regions where partitions overlap.  The second level of
%parallelization offloads time-stepping of the PDE to the GPU.  Evaluation of
%the right hand side of Equation~(\ref{eq:evaluation_with_hyperviscosity}) is
%data-parallel: the solution derivative at each stencil center is evaluated
%independently of the other stencils. This maps well to the GPU, offering decent
%speedup even in unoptimized kernels. Although the stencil weight calculation is
%also data-parallel, we assume that in this context that the weights are
%precomputed and loaded once from disk during the initialization phase. 

%TODO: Need partitioning, global and local index maps, and local ordering for a distributed matrix operation \cite{Saad2003} 

\section{Partitioning}

For ease of development and parallel debugging, partitioning is initially
assumed to be linear within one physical direction (typically the
$x$-direction). Figure~\ref{fig:decomposed_sphere} illustrates a partitioning of
$N=10,201$ nodes on the unit sphere onto four CPUs.

Each partition, illustrated
as a unique color, contains many \emph{stencil centers}. Although \emph{stencil centers} are contained within a partition, there is no requirement for all \emph{stencil nodes} to be contained within the same partition. As a result, many stencils require information updates from neighboring partitions for nodes that are referred to as \emph{ghost nodes} \cite{NeEDREF}. %TODO: need ghost node ref.
In many cases, \emph{ghost nodes} are treated the same as any other stencil node. The CPU process in charge of a partition is fully aware of the ghost node coordinate, current solution value(s), etc.. However, values at ghost nodes are modified by another process, so changes must be explicitly synchronized via an MPI collective for dependent processes to maintain consistency. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:decomposed_sphere}, alternating representations between node points and interpolated surfaces illustrates the
overlap regions where ghost nodes reside. Due to stencil dependencies in each partition, the overlap region representations are double-wide---i.e., they contain a set of ghost nodes for both the left and right partitions. 

As the stencil size increases, the width of the
overlap regions relative to total number of nodes on the sphere proportionally increases. In the case of the unit sphere from Figure~\ref{fig:decomposed_sphere}, the width of the overlap is roughly $\sqrt{n}$ for stencil size $n$. Figure~\ref{fig:decomposed_sphere} shows the case of $n=31$ nodes per stencil. Higher order RBF-FD stencils (i.e., larger stencil sizes) exacerbate the situation by further increasing the number of bytes that must be sent via MPI. Observe that since stencils need not have symmetric dependencies (i.e., if stencil $s_1$ depends on $s_2$, $s_2$ need not depend on $s_1$), the number of ghost nodes for each partition can vary.

\caption{Partitioning of $N=10,201$ nodes to span four processors with stencil size $n=31$. }
\label{fig:decomposed_sphere}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The choice for a linear partitioning is simple and easy to code. Each MPI process has a left and right neighbor, so communication is straightforward. On a high number of processors, there are two issues: 1) increasing the number of processors quickly reduces the width of each partition and can result in stencils dependent on more than one partition in each direction introducing the need for more complex collectives; and 2) with near uniform node distributions the resulting partitions are of unequal size and processors are improperly balanced. Thus, in the case of the sphere, linear partitioning is not ideal. 


Many other options for partitioning the sphere exist. In atmospheric and geophysical communities for example, one often finds the cubed-sphere \cite{Ivan2011, Katta2012}, which transcribes a subdivided cube onto the sphere and assigns projected rectangular elements to individual processors. Another option is the icosahedral geodesic grid \cite{Randall2002}, which evenly balances the computational load by distributing equal sized geodesic triangles across processors. The options for partitioning the sphere are endless, and are outside the scope of this work. 



Other interesting partitionings can be generated with software libraries such as the METIS \cite{Karypis1999} family of algorithms, capable of partitioning and reordering directed graphs produced by RBF-FD stencils. 



%TODO: what is the percentage overlap for $n$? $\frac{1}{2} n^{\frac{1}{d}}$ gives depth into neighbor since n is uniformly sampled we expect a cube shape. (SHould be literature on this...no?)} % assume sphere, sqrt of N for scaling area covered by stencil


In order to partition our nodes, METIS requires an undirected adjacency graph representing the edges that connect nodes. In this case the adjacency graph represents edges connecting nodes in a mesh. For RBF-FD there is no well-defined mesh. Rather, every node is connected to multiple stencil centers.  of connecting stencil nodes to stencil centers. An undirected  To produce this we generate 

The undirected graph is used only for partitioning and subsequently discarded.

\end{center}
\end{figure}



\section{Local node ordering}

After partitioning, each CPU/GPU is responsible for its own subset of nodes. 
To simplify accounting, we track nodes in two ways. Each node is assigned
a global index, that uniquely identifies it. This index follows the node 
and its associated data as it is shuffled between processors. In addition, 
it is important to treat the nodes on each CPU/GPU in an identical manner. 
Implementations on the GPU are more efficient when node indices
are sequential. Therefore, we also assign a local index for the nodes on 
a given CPU, which run from 1 to the maximum number of nodes on that CPU. 

It is convenient to break up the nodes on a given CPU into various sets
according to whether they are sent to other processors, are retrieved from 
other processors, are permanently on the processor, etc. Note as well, 
that each node has a home processor since the RBF nodes are partitioned into 
multiple domains without overlap.
Table~\ref{tbl:stencil_sets}, defines the collection of index lists that each CPU must maintain for both multi-CPU and multi-GPU implementations.

\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:stencilSets2CPU} illustrates a configuration with two 
CPUs and two GPUs, and 9 stencils, four on CPU1, and five on CPU2, separated
by a vertical line in the figure. Each stencil
has size $n=5$. In the top part of the figures, the stencils are laid out
with blue arrows pointing to stencil neighbors and creating the edges of a directed adjacency graph. Note that the connection between two nodes is not 
always bidirectional. For example, node 6 is in the stencil of node 3, but 
node 3 {\em is not\/} a member of the stencil of node 6. 
Gray arrows point to stencil neighbors outside the small window and are not relevant to the following discussion, which focuses only on data flow between 
CPU1 and CPU2. 
Since each CPU is responsible for the derivative evaluation and solution updates for any stencil center, it is clear that some nodes have a stencil with nodes that are on a different CPU. For example, node 8 on CPU1 has a stencil comprised of
nodes 4,5,6,9, and itself. The data associated with node 6 must be retrieved
from CPU2. Similarly, the data from node 5 must be sent to CPU2 to 
complete calculations at the center of node 6.


The set of all nodes that a CPU interacts with is denoted by $\setAllNodes$, which includes not only the nodes stored on the CPU, but the nodes required from other CPUs to complete the calculations. 
The set $\setCenters\in\setAllNodes$ contains the nodes at which the CPU 
will compute derivatives and apply solution updates. 
The set $\setDepend = \setAllNodes \backslash \setCenters$ 
is formed from the set of nodes whose values must be retrieved from another CPU. 
For each CPU, the set $\setProvide\in\setCenters$ is sent to other CPUs. The set $\setBoundary\in\setCenters$ consists of nodes that depend on  values from $\setDepend$ in order to evaluate derivatives. Note that $\setProvide$ and $\setBoundary$ can overlap, but differ in size, since the directed adjacency graph produced by stencil edges is not necessarily symmetric. The set $\setBoundary \backslash \setProvide$ represents nodes that depend on $\setDepend$ but are not sent to other CPUs, while $\setCenters \backslash \setBoundary$ are nodes that have no dependency on information from other CPUs.
The middle section Figure~\ref{fig:stencilSets2CPU} lists global node indices contained in $\setAllNodes$ for each CPU. Global indices are paired with local indices to indicate the node ordering internal to each CPU. The structure of set $\setAllNodes$,
   \begin{equation}
 		\setAllNodes = \{ \mathcal{Q}\backslash\mathcal{B} \ \ \mathcal{B}\backslash\mathcal{O} \ \ \mathcal{O} \ \ \setDepend \},
            \label{eqn:decompose_g}
        \end{equation}
 is designed to simplify both CPU-CPU and CPU-GPU memory transfers by grouping nodes of similar type. The color of the global and local indices in the figure
 indicate the sets to which they belong. They are as follows: white represents $\setCenters \backslash \setBoundary$, 
 yellow represents $\setBoundary \backslash \setProvide$, green indices 
 represent $\setProvide$, and red represent $\setDepend$.

 The structure of $\setAllNodes$ offers two benefits: first, solution values in $\setDepend$ and $\setProvide$ are contiguous in memory and can be copied to or from the GPU without the filtering and/or re-ordering normally required in preparation for efficient data transfers. Second, asynchronous communication allows for the overlap of communication and computation. This will be considered as part of future research on algorithm optimization.  Distinguishing the set $\mathcal{B} \backslash \mathcal{O}$ allows the computation of $\mathcal{Q}\backslash \mathcal{B}$ while waiting on $\mathcal{R}$. 

\authnote{} The local index set is ordered as ${QmB, BmO, O, R}$

Figure~\ref{fig:decomposed_sphere} illustrates a partitioning of
$N=10,201$ nodes on the unit sphere onto four CPUs. Each partition, illustrated
as a unique color, represents set $\setAllNodes$ for a single CPU.  Alternating
representations between node points and interpolated surfaces illustrates the
overlap regions where nodes in sets $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ (i.e., nodes
requiring MPI communication) reside. As stencil size increases, the width of the
overlap regions relative to total number of nodes on the sphere also increases. 




When targeting the GPU, communication of solution or intermediate values is a four step process:
        \begin{enumerate}
    \item Transfer $\mathcal{O}$ from GPU to CPU
	\item Distribute $\mathcal{O}$ to other CPUs, receive $R$ from other CPUs
	\item Transfer $\mathcal{R}$ to the GPU
	\item Launch a GPU kernel to operate on $\mathcal{Q}$
     \end{enumerate} 
The data transfers involved in this process are illustrated at the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:stencilSets2CPU}.
    Each GPU operates on the local indices ordered 
according to Equation~(\ref{eqn:decompose_g}). The set 
$\setProvide$ is copied off the GPU and into CPU memory as one contiguous memory block. The CPU then maps local to global indices and transfers $\setProvide$ to other CPUs. CPUs send only the subset of node values from $\setProvide$ that is required by the destination processors, but it is important to note that node information might be sent to several destinations. 
As the set $\setDepend$ is received, the CPU converts back from global to local indices before copying a contiguous block of memory to the GPU. 

        This approach is scalable to a very large number of 
		processors, since the individual processors do not require the 
		full mapping between RBF nodes and CPUs. 
		
		By scalable here we imply total problem size and processor count. The performance scalability of the code depends on the problem size and the MPI collective. In Figure~\ref{fig:strong_scaling} the strong scaling of $N=10^6$ nodes is tested on Itasca, a supercomputer at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.   



\section{Test Case}

To test and demonstrate scaling of our method, we consider an idealized regular grid in three dimensions. 

verification here is only significant to ensure we are applying all weights. 
We apply weights to calculate derivatives of a test function in X, Y, Z, and the Laplacian. 
the grid is regular and 3D.
We test strong scaling on a $N=160^3$ grid, and weak scaling with $N_p=4000$. This way at $p=1024$ processes we have weak scaling testing the full $N=160^3$ grid. 





\section{Communication Collectives} 

MPI collectives allow information sharing between processes. Our code leverages three collectives: MPI\_Alltoall, MPI\_Alltoallv and MPI\_Isend/MPI\_Irecv. 

The collective operation is essentially transposing information as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mpi_alltoallv_visual}. 

MPI\_Alltoall requires that all processors send and receive an equivalent number of bytes to one another. Since the size must be equivalent for all processors, the send and receive buffers are padded to the maximum message size for any one connection between processors. MPI\_Alltoallv reduces the number of bytes sent and received by allowing processors to specify variable message sizes when communicating. For a small number of processors the variable message size will function well. However, MPI\_Alltoallv requires all processes to connect with every other process, even in the event that 0 bytes are to be sent. Based on the grid decomposition, processors compute on contiguous partitions with a small number of neighboring partitions. By replacing the MPI\_Alltoallv with a MPI\_Isend/MPI\_Irecv combination, the number of collective connections are truncated such that processors only connect to and communicate with essential neighbors that need/provide data. 

The actual implementation of MPI\_Alltoall and MPI\_Alltoallv likely use Isend and Irecv internally.

MPI\_Isend/MPI\_Irecv also allows for overlapping communication and computation by posting receives early 

\subsection{Alltoallv}
As a baseline for scaling we start with MPI\_Alltoallv. 

\authnote{figure: alltoall visual} 

\subsection{Isend/Irecv}

The first improvement on Alltoallv collectives is to truncate the number of connections made between processes. Compact stencils implies an overlap region for each processor that draws values from a limited number of neighboring processors.

\section{CPU Scaling}

\authnote{Show the strong and weak scaling here}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition and indexing, we perform scaling experiments. 

\subsection{Strong Scaling}
Strong scaling tests the growth in time for a fixed total problem size, and a variable number of processors. 

\subsection{Weak Scaling}
Weak scaling considers the amount of time for a fixed problem size per process and variable number of processors. That is to say, each processor has roughly the same amount of work, so as we scale to a large number of processors, changes in time will be the result of increased communication overhead. 

Although our weak scaling results are promising, they also contain a problem. First, since we are subsampling a $160^3$ regular grid to get the first $N=p*4000$ nodes, many of the tests consider domains that are ``L" shaped and have odd partitions with limited connectivity.

\subsection{Bandwidth}

To understand the impact of MPI on these benchmarks we calculate the average and aggregate collective bandwidths. The average bandwidth considers the MPI throughput from the perspective of one processor. 

The aggregate bandwidth reveals when processes saturate the interconnects. 

We consider a simple idealized problem where derivatives are computed over a regular grid generated in 3-D. The experiment computes the SpMV one thousand times. At the end of each SpMV the MPI\_Alltoallv collective is used to synchronize the local derivative vectors. After one thousand iterations, each process computes the local norm of the resulting vector and an MPI\_Reduce collective dra

\chapter{Distributed GPU SpMV}


Distributing SpMV across multiple GPUs poses a new problem: as previous mentioned, the data sent and received via MPI collectives must be copied from device to host and vice-versa. To amortize this cost we introduce a novel overlapping algorithm to hide the cost of communication behind the cost of a concurrent SpMV on the GPU.
