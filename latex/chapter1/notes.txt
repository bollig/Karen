•	Introduction
o	RBF Methods are great for
•	Scattered Data
•	High dimensions
•	Higher order accuracy
•	Etc.
o	RBF methods have a 30+ year history
•	Interpolation: 1970
•	Franke comparison 1982
•	PDE History is only 1995-present
•	The method is still young with limited application
•	Little attention in HPC
o	Targeting HPC
•	Need to focus on hardware that will get us to Petascale 
•	Keep method current
•	GPUs/Accelerators are expected to be (default|common|…) on petascale architectures
•	Target GPUs/Accelerators first
•	GPU for RBF is limited; only one related work
•	Focus on MPI to scale across HPC clusters
•	MPI for RBF is limited; only a few related works
o	We bring together the combination of RBF-FD, MPI, GPU
•	And we demonstrate combinations through applicaton to various problems
•	Implicit and Explicit PDEs
•	Goal is to construct building blocks for a large scale Geophysical simulation
