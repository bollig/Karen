For each topic I need: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Related works (various methods used)
\item Our choice of method
\item Contribution
\end{itemize}


For example: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Our topic of RBF-FD on multiple GPUs is many-faceted. Any PDE solutions on multiple GPUs would involve the following: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item a system assembly
\item a domain decomposition
\item a solver
\item an algorithm for time-stepping
\end{itemize}

\item Our system assembly: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Assemble and solve for weights with RBF-FD
\item multiple RHS to achieve highest throughput
\item Alternative neighbor queries to improve throughput. 
\item Kernel to compute weights on GPU
\end{itemize}


\item Our domain decomposition approach is straightforward:
\begin{itemize} 
\item slices (1-D partitions)
\item METIS for load-balancing
\end{itemize}


\item Our solver:
\begin{itemize} 
\item an OpenCL implementation
\item we compare custom kernels treating stencils as parallel unit vs. matrix optimization
\item consider optimizations presented in clSpMV to achieve most bandwidth
\item we implement GMRES using distributed SpMV and SAXPY operations
\item we implement ILU factorization for preconditioning RBF-FD system
\end{itemize}


\item Our algorithm for time-stepping: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item RK4
\end{itemize}


\item Communication: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item overlapping comm and comp. 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize} 


My approach: 
iterate through papers. update each section with citation and how they approach the subject. Add paper reference to a table indicating their use of algorithms/approaches.
