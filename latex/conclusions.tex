Unanswered Questions: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item If RBF-FD is higher order accurate than FV, why would anyone opt for FV?
\begin{itemize} 
\item the conservative form FV is preferred in physical science since it does not allow loss of (what? mass/energy/???)
\item FV are typically low-order. what is the trade-off in complexity between methods. For a much higher-order RBF-FD if it is not conservative, how many iterations is it accurate consistent with the low-order FV? l
