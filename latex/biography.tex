In 2009, Evan was awarded a Master's Degree in Computational Science from the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University with a thesis titled, ``Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation of Manifolds using the GPU". As a Master's student, Evan worked as both a graduate research and teaching assistant in the Department of Scientific Computing.

During the summer of 2009, Evan was one of 11 participants in the Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS) program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The following year he returned to NCAR for a second internship; this time with Dr. Natasha Flyer in the Institute for Mathematics Applied to Geosciences (IMAGe) division. In 2011, he was invited to return a third time as a graduate student visitor for an extended collaboration with Dr. Flyer between June 2011 and February 2012. 

Evan was briefly employed as a Software Engineer by the Tallahassee, FL branch of Homes.com from August to December 2012.
