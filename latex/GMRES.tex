\chapter{GMRES}

The GMRES algorithm follows Algorithm~\ref{alg:gmres_general}. 

The Arnoldi process can be completed using in a variety of ways. Some libraries like CUSP and \cite{Saad2003} prefer the straightforward Givens rotations because they are easily parallelizable. The givens algorithm is provided in Algorithm~\ref{alg:gmres_givens}

Others like [...] prefer to use an alternate algorithm. This algorithm is demonstrated in Algorithm~\ref{alg:gmres_h}.
